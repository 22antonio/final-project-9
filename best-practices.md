## Web development best practices

# Start with Planning

- Avoid rewriting code by planning ahead (wireframes & mockups)

# Code Smarter, Not Longer

- Try to use shortcuts where possible. (ex. multiple css files, multi-value css)
- Avoid making things complex to where you're the only person that can read it.

# Sprint, don't leap

- Small/Incremental updates over large updates (commit often)

# Accepted standards

- Establish multi-device compatibly (desktop & mobile devices)
- Link your social media channels

## Web design best practices
